       <h1>Welcome to Third Grade Math!</h1>

  <div className='lesson'>
  <h2>Lesson 1: Multiplication</h2>
  <p>Multiplication is a way of adding the same number several times.</p>
  <h3>Example:</h3>
  <p>3 times 4 means 3 groups of 4, or 4 + 4 + 4, which equals 12.</p>
  <h3>Practice:</h3>
  <div>
    <ol>
      <li>2 x 5 = ? (Answer: 10)</li>
      <li>3 x 3 = ? (Answer: 9)</li>
      <li>4 x 6 = ? (Answer: 24)</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  </div>

  <div className='lesson'>
  <h2>Lesson 2: Division</h2>
  <p>Division is splitting something into equal parts or groups. It is the result of "fair sharing".</p>
  <h3>Example:</h3>
  <p>If you have 15 cookies and you want to share them with 3 friends, how many cookies does each friend get? 15 divided by 3 equals 5.</p>
  <h3>Practice:</h3>
  <div>
    <ol>
      <li>20 รท 4 = ? (Answer: 5)</li>
      <li>18 รท 6 = ? (Answer: 3)</li>
      <li>24 รท 8 = ? (Answer: 3)</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  </div>

  <h2>Lesson 3: Fractions</h2>
  <p>Fractions show parts of a whole. They tell us how many parts we have.</p>
  <h3>Example:</h3>
  <p>If you have a pizza and cut it into 4 equal parts, each part is a quarter (1/4) of the pizza.</p>
  <h3>Practice:</h3>
  <div>
    <ol>
      <li>What fraction of the pizza is left if you eat 1 out of 4 slices? (Answer: 3/4)</li>
      <li>If you have 6 candies and you give away 2, what fraction of the candies do you have left? (Answer: 4/6 or 2/3)</li>
      <li>If you cut a pie into 8 equal parts and eat 3, what fraction of the pie is left? (Answer: 5/8)</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  </div>

  <div className='lesson'>
  <h2>Lesson 4: Measurement</h2>
  <p>Measurement helps us find out the length, width, height, or amount of something.</p>
  <h3>Example:</h3>
  <p>If a pencil is 7 inches long and an eraser is 3 inches long, how long are they together?</p>
  <p>Equation: 7 inches + 3 inches = 10 inches</p>
  <p>So, together they are 10 inches long.</p>
  <h3>Practice:</h3>
  <div>
    <ol>
      <li>If a book is 9 inches tall and a notebook is 5 inches tall, what is their combined height? (Answer: 14 inches)</li>
      <li>If you have a rope that is 12 feet long and you cut off 4 feet, how much rope is left? (Answer: 8 feet)</li>
    </ol>

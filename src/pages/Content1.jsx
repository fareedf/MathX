      <h2>Lesson 1: Addition and Subtraction</h2>
      <h3>Additon</h3>
      <p>Addition is when we put things together. When we add, we find out how many we have in total.</p>
      <h3>Example:</h3>
      <p>If you have 3 apples and you get 4 more, how many apples do you have now?</p>
      <p>Equation: 3 + 4 = 7</p>
      <p>So, you have 7 apples in total.</p>
      <h3>Practice:</h3>
      <div>
      <ol>
        <li>
        2 + 5 = ?
        </li>
        <li>
        1 + 6 = ?  
        </li>
        <li>
        4 + 3 = ?
        </li>
      </ol>
      </div>
